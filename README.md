# Site-Loja-Tom-Store

Here's my first work in CSS,HTML and JavaScript. 
I created this web site store for many sort of products and I just programed the slide images and the button menu. In the future I want to create a page to register new products, categories and clients, but for who wants to sharp his skills with this, it's a excelente oportunitie, one detail it's in portuguese.

TO USE
After you made the download and unpack and open the file, you can open the Html and see my work without any problem.
